🔒 SecurePrint Pro - Enterprise-Grade Secure Printing Solution
A sophisticated secure printing system that prevents unauthorized access to confidential documents by implementing a pull-printing architecture with one-time passwords and SQLite database management.

🌟 Features

🛡️ Security First

One-Time Password Authentication: Each print job generates a unique 8-character password
Pull Printing Architecture: Documents only print when user is physically present at the printer
SQLite Database: Secure storage of user credentials and print jobs with proper encryption
No Document Storage: Documents are temporarily held in memory and purged after printing
👥 User Management

Role-Based Access Control: Multiple user levels with different permissions
Secure Authentication: SHA-256 hashed passwords with salt protection
Print Job History: Complete audit trail of all printing activities
User Session Management: Secure login/logout system
🖨️ Printing Workflow

Client-Server Architecture: Distributed system for enhanced security
Real-Time Status Updates: Live tracking of print job status
Automatic Cleanup: Scheduled removal of expired print jobs
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
📊 Monitoring & Analytics

Comprehensive Logging: Detailed audit logs for compliance requirements
Job Statistics: Track printing habits and resource usage
Error Reporting: Detailed error messages and troubleshooting guides
Performance Metrics: Monitor system health and response times
🏗️ Architecture

Data Flow:

Authentication: User logs in with credentials
Job Submission: Document sent to secure print server
OTP Generation: Unique one-time password created
Physical Release: User enters OTP at printer to release document
Audit Logging: Complete transaction recorded in database
🚀 Quick Start

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
SQLite3
Network connectivity
Installation

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secureprint-pro.git
cd secureprint-pro
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the System

bash
# Terminal 1 - Start the server
python run_server.py

# Terminal 2 - Run the client
python main.py
📋 Usage

Login with your credentials (default: user123/password123)
Select a document for secure printing
Receive OTP - note the one-time password
Approach printer and enter the OTP
Collect document - printing only occurs after authentication
